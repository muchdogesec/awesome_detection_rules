# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Make sure your submission is not a duplicate.
* Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Adhere to the table formatting (namely keep to the alphabetical order by category, name), which makes for easier reading. I've pasted a snippet of the structure to be completed for each record below.
* The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Thanks for your suggestions!
